Professional Statement


I am a highly motivated and open minded cybersecurity analyst looking to start a long career in cybersecurity.  I have strong verbal communication skills as well as the technical skills and a track history of problem solving which I bring to every challenge.  My main goal is to work to secure people as either customers or members of the public, from emerging threats to their personal data.  I place a high value on a strong defensive posture and regular refinement and adaptation of procedures. I embrace change and would be looking to further develop my skills in Linux and Python.
